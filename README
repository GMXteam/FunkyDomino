This repository contains sources for Funky Domino.

But it contains much more than that in fact since it integrates the latest AndEngine plugins in a woking project. Since some of these plugins appeared to not compile correctly, I have made a AndEngineExampleModded project which is working without those bad plugins. I will also try to keep all them updated as they are all available on GitHub (check nicolasgramlich out !) ;)

AndEngine extensions in the repository and not forked for a stability purpose. We might fork them somedays...

Enabled extensions :
    AndEngineAugmentedRealityExtension
    AndEngineLiveWallpaperExtension
    AndEngineMODPlayerExtension
    AndEnginePhysicsBox2DExtension
    AndEngineSVGTextureRegionExtension
    AndEngineTexturePackerExtension
